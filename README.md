This project consists of creating a chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo language model to generate responses to user input. The chatbot runs in the terminal and communicates with the OpenAI api using the OpenAI python library.

## ðŸ˜¸ Why the project?

The goal of this project is to create a terminal chatbot using the ChatGPT API to provide users with a smooth and satisfying chat experience. This chatbot will allow users to interact with ChatGPT's artificial intelligence directly from the command line, without the need for a graphical user interface.

The use of Python as a programming language will allow the implementation of a simple and easy to understand terminal chatbot. The ChatGPT API will provide the artificial intelligence needed to generate accurate and consistent responses to user queries.

This project will also allow developers to improve their skills in Python and chatbot development. Furthermore, they can also use this project as a foundation to build more complex and sophisticated chatbots in the future.

In short, the main goal of this project is to provide users with an easy and accessible way to interact with ChatGPT's artificial intelligence, while also offering an opportunity for developers to improve their Python and chatbot development skills.

## Requirements

- [x] [Python>=3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [x] [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [x] [Openai API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Setting

The program has a series of settings that allow the model to behave in one way or another. These are found in the [settings.py](./settings.py) script.
